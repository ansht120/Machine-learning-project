## 1 · Image Classification — Handwritten Digit Recognition

**Problem:** Automatically recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images — the foundational task behind postal code sorting and cheque digitization.

**Dataset:** MNIST — 60,000 training + 10,000 test grayscale images (28×28 px), loaded directly via `keras.datasets`.

### Model Architecture

```
Input (28×28×1)
  ↓ Conv2D(32, 3×3, ReLU)  →  MaxPooling2D(2×2)
  ↓ Conv2D(64, 3×3, ReLU)  →  MaxPooling2D(2×2)
  ↓ Conv2D(64, 3×3, ReLU)
  ↓ Flatten  →  Dense(64, ReLU)  →  Dense(10, Softmax)
```

**Optimizer:** Adam · **Loss:** Sparse categorical cross-entropy · **Epochs:** 5

### Results

| Epoch | Train Accuracy | Train Loss |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | 88.98% | 0.3449 |
| 2 | 98.46% | 0.0504 |
| 3 | 99.01% | 0.0332 |
| 4 | 99.21% | 0.0253 |
| 5 | 99.43% | 0.0185 |

> **Test accuracy: 98.83%** (loss 0.0491) — the small train/test gap indicates the model generalized well without significant overfitting.

**Key steps:** pixel normalization to `[0,1]` · channel-dimension reshaping · prediction visualization with Matplotlib · model exported to `mnist_model.h5`

## 2 · Spam Email Detection

**Problem:** Classify emails as spam or legitimate — the classic asymmetric-cost problem, where a spam email reaching the inbox is a mild annoyance but a legitimate email wrongly filtered could be a missed job offer.

### Pipeline

```
Raw email text
  ↓ Text preprocessing (NLTK) — cleaning, tokenization
  ↓ TF-IDF vectorization — weight terms by discriminative power
  ↓ Logistic Regression classifier
  ↓ Evaluate on held-out test set
```

### Results

| Split | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Training | 96.11% |
| **Test** | **96.32%** |

> Test accuracy slightly *exceeding* training accuracy is a healthy sign — the model hasn't memorized the training set and generalizes to unseen emails. A large gap in the other direction would signal overfitting.

**Why TF-IDF over raw word counts:** it down-weights words appearing across all emails ("the", "and") and up-weights terms that actually distinguish spam from legitimate mail, so the classifier learns from signal rather than noise.

## 3 · Sales Prediction

**Problem:** Predict product sales from outlet and item attributes — MRP, outlet size, item type, and outlet location. Sales forecasting drives inventory planning: under-forecast and you stock out; over-forecast and you tie up capital in unsold goods.

### Pipeline

```
Raw sales data
  ↓ Handle missing values and duplicates
  ↓ Exploratory data analysis (distribution, correlation)
  ↓ Encode categorical variables (outlet type, item category)
  ↓ Train Linear Regression
  ↓ Evaluate — MSE, MAE, RMSE, R²
```

### Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **R² Score** | **0.91** |
| Mean Squared Error | 2.86 |

> R² of 0.91 means the model explains 91% of the variance in sales. For a linear model on retail data that's strong — it suggests the relationship between MRP, outlet characteristics and sales is largely linear, so a more complex tree-based model would buy little here.

## 4 · Car Price Prediction

**Problem:** Estimate a used car's selling price from year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine specs. Resale pricing is the core of any used-vehicle marketplace — mispricing costs either seller margin or buyer trust.

### Pipeline

```
Vehicle listings data
  ↓ Clean and inspect
  ↓ Feature engineering — derive vehicle age from year
  ↓ Encode categoricals (fuel type, transmission, seller type)
  ↓ Train Random Forest Regressor
  ↓ Evaluate — MAE, MSE, R²
```

**Why Random Forest here:** depreciation isn't linear. A car loses value fastest in its first years and the curve flattens later; mileage interacts with age rather than acting independently. A tree ensemble captures those non-linear interactions without needing them specified in advance — which is precisely why it suits this problem where Linear Regression suited sales prediction.

## 5 · Sentiment Analysis — Tweet Classification

**Problem:** Classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral — the core of brand monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

**Dataset:** 500 labelled tweets with text, sentiment, timestamp, and platform metadata.

### Pipeline

```
Raw text
  ↓ Lowercase  →  strip non-alphabetic characters
  ↓ Stopword removal (NLTK)  →  WordNet lemmatization
  ↓ TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams + bigrams, 5,000 features)
  ↓ Logistic Regression (class_weight='balanced', max_iter=1000)
```

Stratified 80/20 train-test split preserves class proportions.

### Results

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Negative | 0.85 | 0.41 | 0.55 | 27 |
| Neutral | 0.63 | 0.90 | 0.74 | 40 |
| Positive | 0.80 | 0.73 | 0.76 | 33 |
| **Accuracy** | | | **0.71** | 100 |
| **Weighted avg** | 0.75 | 0.71 | 0.70 | 100 |

> **Honest read:** the model is precise on negative tweets (0.85) but recalls only 41% of them — it misses many, usually labelling them neutral. With just 27 negative samples in the test set, more data is the clearest path to improvement. `class_weight='balanced'` was used specifically to counteract this imbalance.

**Includes** a `predict_sentiment()` helper for inference on unseen text.

## 6 · Music Recommendation System

**Problem:** Given a song a listener enjoys, suggest similar tracks — the content-based approach used when you lack the user-interaction history that collaborative filtering requires.

**Dataset:** 100 songs with title, artist, genre, release year, duration, listen date, and platform.

### Approach

```
Raw listening data
  ↓ Deduplicate to unique songs
  ↓ Feature engineering — aggregate listen counts per song
  ↓ One-hot encode categorical features (genre, artist)
  ↓ StandardScaler normalization
  ↓ Cosine similarity matrix across all song pairs
  ↓ recommend_song(title, top_k) → K nearest neighbours
```

**Why content-based:** it sidesteps the cold-start problem — a new song can be recommended immediately from its own attributes, with no listening history needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ansht120/Machine-learning-project.git
cd Machine-learning-project

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow nltk jupyter

# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### Running Each Project

**Image Classification** — no setup needed; MNIST downloads automatically on first run.

```bash
jupyter notebook image_classification_project/imageclassification.ipynb
```

**Spam Detection · Sales Prediction · Car Price Prediction** — open the notebook in each project folder and run all cells.

```bash
jupyter notebook spam_email_detection_project/
jupyter notebook sales_prediction_project/
jupyter notebook car_price_prediction_project/
```

> **Datasets not included.** These three notebooks expect `spam_mail.csv`, `sales dataset.csv`, and `car_data.csv` respectively, which aren't committed to this repository. Place your own copy alongside the notebook, or update the `read_csv()` path in the first cell. The notebooks retain their saved outputs, so the results are reproducible reading even without the raw files.

**Sentiment Analysis** — downloads NLTK corpora on first run.

```bash
cd sentiment_Analysis_project/notebooks
jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```

> The notebook loads `sentiment_analysis.csv`. Either run it from the `dataset/` folder or update the path to `../dataset/sentiment_analysis.csv`.

**Music Recommendation**

```bash
cd music_recommendation_system/notebooks
jupyter notebook music_recommendation.ipynb
```

> The notebook loads `MusicDataset.csv`. Update the path to `../dataset/music_dataset.csv` to match this repository's layout.
